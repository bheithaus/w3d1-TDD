# Remove dups
#
# Array has a uniq method that removes duplicates from an array. It returns the unique elements in the order in which they first appeared:
#
# [1, 2, 1, 3, 3].uniq # => [1, 2, 3]
# Write your own uniq method, called my_uniq; it should take in an Array and return a new array. It should not call uniq.
#
# One special feature of Ruby classes is that they are open; we can add new methods to existing classes. Here, add your my_uniq method to Array:
#
# class Array
#   def my_uniq
#     # ...
#   end
# end
# This is also called monkey patching, and it is often frowned upon to, after-the-fact, add new methods to a class. However, it is occasionally useful and interesting to try out.
